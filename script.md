Hello, my name is Vincent Nahn.
I am a freethinker, a wannabe capitalist, and someone who loves skipping classes.

In this presentation I am going to talk a bit about revamping legacy code.
Legacy code which each and everyone of you has seen. I am 100% certain that you will find this presentation very interesting.
