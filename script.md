Hello, my name is Vincent Nahn.
I am a freethinker, a wannabe capitalist, and someone who loves skipping classes.

## Introduction

In this presentation I am going to talk a bit about revamping legacy code.
Legacy code which each and everyone of you has seen. I am 100% certain that you will find this presentation very interesting.




## Closing words

What are some final remarks about this presentation?
Science is not equal to Engineering.
You can be Asia's best university but still have a shitty course registration website.

Thank you for your attention. Now enjoy some pixelated confetti.
